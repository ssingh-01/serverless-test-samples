# Python: Serverless Test Workshop

## Introduction
This project contains automated test sample code samples for serverless applications written in Python. The project demonstrates several techniques for executing tests including mocking, emulation and testing in the cloud specifically when interacting with the Amazon DynamoDB service. Based on current tooling, we recommend customers **focus on testing in the cloud** as much as possible. 

The project uses the [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) (SAM) CLI for configuration, testing and deployment.
